# WIDL Data Analyst Task Report

## 1. Description of the Task
As part of my educational journey in the **Generation Data Bootcamp**, I completed an individual project designed to assess my practical skills in data analysis using **Excel**. The project involved analyzing a dataset containing weekly avocado sales across American stores.

The objective was to explore the data and answer the following business questions:

- Are there any macro trends over time relating to avocados across all regions?
- Which regions had the highest demand for avocados in 2018?
- Is there a difference in demand for conventional versus organic avocados?
- How does avocado pricing impact demand?

The analysis was required to be presented entirely in **Excel**, using appropriate charts and visualizations to clearly communicate insights and trends.

## 2. Challenges Faced and Solutions

One of the main challenges occurred while addressing **Question 2 – Regions with Highest Demand**.  
The dataset included a mix of **individual cities** and **large geographic regions** (e.g. *West*, *SouthEast*). Comparing sales figures across these different geographic levels would result in inaccurate conclusions.

To resolve this issue, I divided the data into two distinct groups:
- **Regions**
- **Cities / Metropolitan Areas**

Separate bar charts were created for each group, ensuring fair and meaningful comparisons within the same geographic level.

Another challenge arose when analyzing **Question 4 – Price vs Demand**.  
The dataset contained a wide range of average price values, making it impractical to assess demand at each individual price point.

To address this, I grouped prices into **price buckets (ranges)** and calculated total demand for each bucket. This approach allowed for a clearer visualization of how demand changes as prices increase or decrease.

## 3. Answers to Questions
To answer the project questions, I developed an **interactive Excel dashboard** that enables exploration of the dataset from multiple perspectives. The dashboard allows users to:

- Observe overall sales trends and seasonality
- Identify regional and city-level demand patterns
- Compare demand for conventional and organic avocados
- Analyze the relationship between average price and demand
- Review sales distribution across different package types

This interactive format supports deeper analysis and makes key insights easier to identify.
